            I recently decided to move to Israel to study data science, where I am currently finishing up a data science fellowship at Israel Tech Challenge, specializing in NLP and computer vision. I just completed a 5-week project at Innoviz, which manufactures lidar for autonomous vehicles. There, I was in charge of gathering data about autonomous vehicle trips using ROS and Python, storing the data in CouchDB, and displaying trip metrics in a front end written in Javascript and Angular 7.

            Before I came to Israel, I had been working at BlueMetal Architects in Boston, MA, a software consulting company. I specialized mostly in Cloud and IoT solutions for clients across various fields, including healthcare, manufacturing, security, and food service. There I was exposed to different industries and technological stacks on a constant basis, giving me a very wide breadth of experience in a short amount of time. I became skilled in Microsoft Azure and ASP.NET web API technologies, becoming a lead developer for projects in these areas as well as lead front end development in several Angular2, React.js and node.js projects. I also developed an iOS application in Swift, as well as significant time doing database administration work in SQL Server. Not only did I get thrown into the deep end with many of these technologies on a regular basis, I also learned the higher-level capabilities of system architecture and scalability. My work earned me a promotion as well as the company-wide MVP award in Q2 2017.

            Before my work at BlueMetal, I was a Software Developer at Epic Systems in Madison, WI. Theyâ€™re the largest electronic medical record company in the USA, and I was working on their ambulatory application. My work required me to be able to work with highly secure and private patient data, as well as gave me in-depth and first-hand knowledge of the laws and regulations of the US healthcare system.
